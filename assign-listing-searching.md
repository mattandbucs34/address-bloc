1\. Performing a search of a sorted by name IRS database for a taxpayer name

>Binary search. IRS database is quite large and it is sorted. The search would be quicker with the binary search.

2\. Searching through an unsorted list containing the days of the weekend

>Iterative or ORM search. Small amount of data which allows for a quick search by searching each object.

3\. Given a list of the planets in the Milky Way in ascending order by size, search for a planet with a given size.

>Binary Search. Large amounts of data because there are a massive amount of planets in the Milky Way. The list is sorted and the value it is sorted on is the value we want to search by also.

4\. Searching for a checkpoint name in an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints.

>Iterative or ORM search. I would probably use an ORM search just because I wouldn't want to loop through an array to find the particular checkpoint I want. The checkpoints are unsorted, which means the best approach is to look through individual objects.
